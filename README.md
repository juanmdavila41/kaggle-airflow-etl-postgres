# kaggle-airflow-etl-postgres
This project implements an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that extracts data from Kaggle using the Kaggle API, processes it with Apache Airflow, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database. The goal is to automate data extraction and loading to facilitate the analysis and management of large volumes of global economic data.
